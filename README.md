# Inventory Management System (Side Project 1)

## Project Description

This side project aims to reinforce the lessons on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Collections Framework, and Unit Testing. Each student will build a standalone Java application that serves as an Inventory Management System. The primary features include the ability to add, delete, and update products in the inventory.

## Skills to Apply
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Collections Framework
- Unit Testing
- Design Patterns

## Features

- **Add Products**: Ability to add new products to the inventory.
- **Delete Products**: Ability to remove existing products from the inventory.
- **Update Products**: Ability to modify the details of products in the inventory.

## Design Patterns Implemented

- **Singleton Pattern**: For maintaining a single instance of the Inventory class.
- **Observer Pattern**: For event handling and notifications related to inventory changes.
- **Strategy Pattern**: For interchangeable algorithms related to inventory management.
- **Factory Method Pattern**: For creating different types of product objects.
- **Command Pattern**: For implementing undoable actions like add, delete, or update.
